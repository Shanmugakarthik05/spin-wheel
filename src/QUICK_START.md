## Troubleshooting

### "Team name already exists"
**Problem**: Someone already registered with that name  
**Solution**: Choose a different team name

### "Cannot see my team in admin dashboard"
**Problem**: Sync delay  
**Solution**: Wait 3-5 seconds, it will appear automatically

### "Can't advance round"
**Problem**: Not all teams have questions OR no teams selected  
**Solution**: 
- Ensure all teams have spun the wheel
- Check at least one team in Teams tab

### "Wheel won't spin"
**Problem**: Already spun in this round  
**Solution**: You can only spin once per round, wait for admin to advance

### "Team was deleted"
**Problem**: Admin didn't select your team for next round  
**Solution**: Only selected teams advance, contact event organizer
